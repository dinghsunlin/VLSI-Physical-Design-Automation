--- How to Compile
    Under this directory, enter the following command:
        $ make
    This will automatically delete the old executable file "hw2" in the directory "../bin/" and existing result files in "../output/", then generate the new one in the same directory.

--- How to Run:
    Under this directory, enter the following command (take 1st testcase as example):
        $ make tc_1
    This will execute "hw2" and read "p2-1.cells" and "p2-1.nets" under the directory "../testcases/" as input data and write the result into "p2-1.out" in the directory "../output/".
    You can replace tc_1 with tc_2 to tc_5 to execute and produce the result of each testcase.

    If you want to execute all testcases at the same time, enter the following command instead:
        $ make out

--- How to Verify:
    Similar as above. Under this directory, enter the following command (take 1st result as example):
        $ make ts_1
    You can use ts_1 to ts_5 to verify each result.

    If you want to verify all results at the same time, enter the following command instead:
        $ make ver

--- How to Clean:
    Under this directory, enter the following command:
        $ make clean
    This will delete the executable file "hw2" in the directory "../bin/" and the result files of testcases in the directory "../output/".
